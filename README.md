# Trip Planner
A web application that allows multiple users to collaborate on a trip itinerary in real time. Changes made by any one user will update the trip itinerary for every user who is currently viewing the trip. Any text entered will be parsed by the application for keywords such as locations, events, and times. These keywords will then be used to search the web for possible additions to the trip itinerary similar to existing events already added by the user. Users can approve these additions and they will be added to the itinerary. Trip itineraries can be saved to be edited later or shared with other users on the website as inspiration for their own trip.
