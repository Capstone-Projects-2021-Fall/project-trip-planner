In order to use these, the following scripts will need to be altered: 
	common.js
	itinerary.js
specifically, the following function calls must be altered with the word "export" before the function definition (that is, "export function" instead of "function").
	
itinerary.js:
	initMap

common.js:
	fillItineraries
	GetDateTimeOrNull
	GetDateOrNull
	IsNullOrWhitespace
	GetValidStringOrNull

the current web design is incompatible with modular testing, (it expects "script" type js instead of "module" type js, and the fix is more involved than just switching the types).
